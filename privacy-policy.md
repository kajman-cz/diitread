## Diit Read Comments

### 1. Data Collection and Storage
The **Diit Read Comments** extension stores minimal data locally on your device to enhance your experience when reading comments on diit.cz and cdr.cz. Specifically, the extension saves:

- The **highest ID** of comments displayed on a visited page with comments.
- The **total number** of comments on a visited page with comments.

This data is stored in your browser's **localStorage** and is used solely to visually distinguish previously viewed comments when you revisit the same page or a page that links to the page with comments you visited.

### 2. Data Usage
The stored data is used only within your browser and never transmitted to any external server, third party, or the developer of this extension.

### 3. Data Retention and Deletion
All stored data remains in your browser's localStorage indefinitely unless:
- You manually clear your browserâ€™s local storage - all keys with prefix **lc-** for websites diit.cz and cdr.cz.

### 4. Third-Party Services
This extension does not use third-party services, analytics, or trackers.

### 5. Your Rights and Control
Since the extension does not collect personal data or send any data externally, no additional user controls or settings are required. However, you can always clear stored data manually via your browser settings.
